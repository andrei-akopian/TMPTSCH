Yeah, my naming sense is bad.

[Takahashi Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) Presentations
Have a phrase per slide.

Now feature showcase!

Hit the H key

Hit the F key

There is a dark mode toggle

Here is a [link](https://github.com/andrei-akopian/TakahashiSentHtml)
Check if it works 

Link to repo/help is in top right corner

Images also work

@https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg
^ Look at this notation for images!
// Only one image per slide, no text

Hit the E key
and go back a slide

Now QR CODES!!!

In the orange settings
Click on QR Code dropdown
and pick either option

All link will now show QR Codes!
// Go back to the slide with the link

Now presenter's Notes

Checkmark the box on the top left
// And hit R (refresh slides)

Now see the dev console:
(rightclick > inspect > console)
// Your notes will appear here
// Lines starting with "//" will become presetner notes.
// Now go to the next slides, the notes for them should appear. Check the editor to see the syntax.
// (the notes on the previous slides are just for showcase)

Want to make your own presentation?

Well, the built-in editor is kinda bad
// I may or may not go fix it

So you will have to write some plaintext files
and click [Choose File] to import them
// Not newbie friendly... yeah
