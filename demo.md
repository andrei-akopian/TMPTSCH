This text isn't displayed for... reasons
I found a hack in my own program and idk what to do about it...

Hit the E key 
and go back a slide

Now QR CODES!!!

In the orange settings
Click on QR Code dropdown
and pick either option

Hit the R key (once)
// And go back to the slide with the link

Now presenter's Notes

Checkmark the box on the top left
// And hit R

Open the dev console:
(rightclick > inspect > console)
// Go back and forth between slides
// Text starting with "//" will become presetner notes.
// (the notes on the previous slides are just for showcase)

Want to make your own presentation?

Well, the built-in editor is kinda bad 

So you will have to write some plaintext files
and click [Choose File] to import them

Check repo for more instructions & info
