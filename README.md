# TMPTSCH
Stands for **Takahashi Method Presentation Tool Sent Clone HTML**

As the name suggests this is a presentation making tool based on the [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) and inspired by the [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) (from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/)), [Weenote](https://github.com/jed/weenote), and [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big), while also maintaining some compatibility with them. 

But contradictory to the principles of the method this Clone is bloated with functionality while remaning a single html file so you can easily save and use it offline.
