# TMPTSCH
Stands for **Takahashi Method Presentation Tool Sent Clone HTML**

As the name suggests this is a presentation making tool based on the [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) and inspired by the [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) (from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/)), [Weenote](https://github.com/jed/weenote), and [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big), while also maintaining some compatibility with them. 

But contradictory to the principles of the method this Clone is bloated with functionality while remaning a single html file so you can easily save and use it offline.

# [Try](https://andrei-akopian.github.io/TakahashiSentHtml/)

## Install/Download

### Web version
If you already have a (text-only) presentation file for the original `sent`, you can go streight to [the site](https://andrei-akopian.github.io/TakahashiSentHtml/) and clicl `Choose File` in the top left corner.

Why text only (no images)?

Obviously the website can't read images that are localy on your computer. However, using `@https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Example.jpg` (a link to an image) also works. Note that this feature isn't backward compatible with `sent`.

### Download

If you want it all to be local with no contact to the internet, you can just hit Ctrl + S and save the website as html. Because of the way I made it, it will remain as a single file (and the slides you already created will be saved as well).

- [ ] Features described above are not yet polished.

## Usage

Standard `sent` syntax, if you know it, you are good to go. (check image syntax tho!)

If you don't, come back another day when I have better instructions ready.

### Hotkeys

`e` toggles the slide editor.

`<-` and `->` arrows can be used to navigate slides.

### Images

If your have saved the this tool as a `.html` file by hitting Ctrl + S as I described in the [Download](#download) section, you will be able to get image files using usual `@image.png`.

If you are using the [online version](https://andrei-akopian.github.io/TakahashiSentHtml/), you won't be able to use local images, but you can instead link images through their url (`@https://example.com/image.png`).
